# TodoList 

TodoList is an App that allows users to enter their tasks and save them in the localStorage of the browser. The user can filter the list of tasks by typing keywords in the filter field.

Once a task is completed, the user can delete it by clicking on the trash can icon. The user can delete all tasks by clicking the *CLEAR TASKS* button.

Materialize and Font Awesome are used for UI styling.
